# Pancreatic Cancer Classification Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## Abstract
Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest forms of cancer, with a high mortality rate due to late diagnosis and limited treatment options. This report presents a comprehensive analysis of pancreatic cancer classification using both Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. By leveraging urinary biomarkers and imaging analysis, the proposed methodology aims to improve early detection and classification accuracy. The project achieves high accuracy rates with algorithms such as Random Forest Classifier, Naive Bayes, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

## Introduction
Pancreatic cancer poses a significant challenge in the field of oncology due to its asymptomatic nature in the early stages and rapid progression. Early detection can significantly improve patient outcomes, making the development of efficient and reliable classification systems crucial. This project combines ML and DL techniques to analyze both structured (urinary biomarkers) and unstructured data (imaging) to classify pancreatic tumors as either malignant or normal.
